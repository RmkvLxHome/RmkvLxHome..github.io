        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          Alcohol may not be humanity’s greatest invention, and when misused, it
          can cause irreparable harm to individuals and society. However,
          banning it isn’t the answer—it’s a significant part of our economy and
          culture. That’s why we take on the responsibility of destroying
          alcohol the right way: responsibly, sustainably, and without harm to
          the environment or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Triangle Alcohol Recyclers, we use the most advanced
          biotechnologies (our own livers!) to safely process alcohol,
          converting it into substances beneficial to plants and the
          environment. Through our efforts, we reduce the likelihood of alcohol
          falling into the wrong hands, mitigate the risks of misuse, and
          contribute to a greener, healthier world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based in the NC Triangle area, we combine community care,
          environmental stewardship, and personal sacrifice to make a positive
          impact—one eco-friendly session at a time.
